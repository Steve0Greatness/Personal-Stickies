# Why is this allowed to be here?
Neither of the 2 images here are under the licence that the rest of this repository is.

## GitHub
GitHub allows the use of their logo as long as it fits [these rules on usage of their logo(s)](https://github.com/logos). The usage falls under the second thing that you're allowed to do:

>  Use the Mark in social buttons to link to your GitHub profile or project

We're using it as a way to indentify on `/credits` that the user has a GitHub profile.

## Scratch
In the [Scratch Terms of Service](https://scratch.mit.edu/terms_of_use/) 5.4:

> You may use the Scratch Logo to refer to the Scratch website and programming language.

From the ambiguous meaning, it seems like Scratch allows you to use thier logo to refer to the Scratch website; possibly meaning you are allowed to use it while linking to someone's profile on Scratch. If you are a member of the Scratch team, and you disagree, please leave an issue.
