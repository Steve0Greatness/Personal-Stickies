		<h2>The current State of Personal Stickies</h2>
		<p>Personal Stickies is no longer being activly worked on. I've been wanting to do something with Personal Stickies for awhile now, but I really haven't had a clue as to what to do. I'll do my best to keep the site in a working state, and I'll still take feedback; but Personal Stickies is no longer my #1 priority. I've been spending more time on personal projects and the occasional. The site might get an update if anything major comes up breaking somethings, or if somebody has an idea that would improve the user experience--but don't expect to see this project getting any updates. Thanks for using Person Stickies, and thank you for all the feedback. This was a great learning experence for me, and I look forward to making something else soon. Have a nice day!</p>
